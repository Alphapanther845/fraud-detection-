Fraud Detection  
Overview:
This project is focused on building a fraud detection system that identifies potentially fraudulent activities based on transaction data. The goal is to create a model that can accurately distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions, providing valuable insights for risk management in financial institutions.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and transformation of raw transaction data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data patterns, distributions, and relationships between features.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve the model's performance.
Modeling: Training and evaluating machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
Evaluation Metrics: Using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
Deployment: The trained model is deployed using [Flask/Streamlit/Heroku] for real-time fraud detection.

Dataset
Source: The dataset used in this project can be obtained from  Kaggle
Description: The dataset contains features such as transaction amount, time, location, and various other factors that are indicative of fraudulent behavior.
Data Fields:
TransactionID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
Amount: The transaction amount.
Time: Timestamp of the transaction.
Location: Location of the transaction.
... (Include other relevant features)
Usage
Data Preprocessing: Run the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook to clean and transform the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Use the EDA.ipynb notebook to visualize and understand data patterns.
Training the Model: Execute train_model.py to train the model on preprocessed data.
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model performance using the evaluate_model.py script.
bash
Copy code
python evaluate_model.py
Deployment: For deploying the model, use the app.py file.
bash
Copy code
python app.py

Results
Best Model: Random forest  achieved the highest ROC-AUC score of 0.95, with a Precision of 0.92 and Recall of 0.90.
Feature Importance: The most important features for predicting fraud were Transaction Amount, Location, and Time.
